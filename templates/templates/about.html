    <h2>Our Specialty: Al Pastor Tacos</h2>
    <p>Al Pastor is a traditional Mexican cooking technique that dates back centuries. The iconic spinning vertical rotisserie, called a "trompo," slowly roasts marinated meat infused with spices, pineapple, and aromatic herbs. This method creates incredibly tender, flavorful meat that's the foundation of our signature tacos.</p>
    
    <p>Our Al Pastor tacos feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slow-roasted marinated pork cooked to perfection</li>
        <li>Fresh pineapple for authentic flavor and sweetness</li>
        <li>Homemade soft corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Crispy onion and fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Our signature house salsa</li>
    </ul>
